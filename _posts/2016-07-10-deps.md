title: refs, deps.json
---

If you author and publish ASP.NET Core application you would find `appname.deps.json` and `refs` folder in it’s output, this post would focus on motivation for this file and ways of its use.

# Runtime type discovery

For some time main runtime assembly discovery mechanisms in .Net Frameworkd were `AppDomain.GetLoadedAssemblies()` and `Assembly.GetReferencedAssemblies()` which had some issues namely not preserving references that were not used in code, taking long time to load whole assembly graph. 

DNX had solution to this problem by means of ILibraryManager interface which allowed access to package based dependency graph instead assembly-based and was faster and easier to use.

Requirement for dependency model arose with deprecation of DNX and subsequent loss of those host provided services. In csproj world only information preserved about dependencies are assembly references so we needed a replacement to fix both problems.

# Trim project.lock.json
deps.json was designed as trimmed version of project file which only contains single TFM/rid runtime target and optionally  single TFM compilation target. Based on this information we could gather all information required for runtime dependency graph walking and compilation.

Typical `deps.json` file looks like:

```
{
  "runtimeTarget": {
    "name": ".NETCoreApp,Version=v1.0",
    "signature": "09db60146a5b8a0d40c5ea0fb7485ab3bbdd4a1a"
  },
  "compilationOptions": {},
  "targets": {
    ".NETCoreApp,Version=v1.0": {
      "TestApp/1.0.0": {
        "dependencies": {
          "Newtonsoft.Json": "9.0.1"
        },
        "runtime": {
          "TestApp.dll": {}
        }
      },
      "Newtonsoft.Json/9.0.1": {
        "dependencies": {
          "System.Runtime.Serialization.Primitives": "4.1.1"
        },
        "runtime": {
          "lib/netstandard1.0/Newtonsoft.Json.dll": {}
        }
      },
      "System.Runtime.Serialization.Primitives/4.1.1": {
        "runtime": {
          "lib/netstandard1.3/System.Runtime.Serialization.Primitives.dll": {}
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "libraries": {
    "TestApp/1.0.0": {
      "type": "project",
      "serviceable": false,
      "sha512": ""
    },
    "Newtonsoft.Json/9.0.1": {
      "type": "package",
      "serviceable": true,
      "sha512": "sha512-U82mHQSKaIk+lpSVCbWYKNavmNH1i5xrExDEquU1i6I5pV6UMOqRnJRSlKO3cMPfcpp0RgDY+8jUXHdQ4IfXvw=="
    },
    "System.Runtime.Serialization.Primitives/4.1.1": {
      "type": "package",
      "serviceable": true,
      "sha512": "sha512-HZ6Du5QrTG8MNJbf4e4qMO3JRAkIboGT5Fk804uZtg3Gq516S7hAqTm2UZKUHa7/6HUGdVy3AqMQKbns06G/cg=="
    }
  }
}
```

# Compilation

Other feature that is more specific to MVC is Razor which dynamically generates C# code and compiles it at runtime, by it’s design you need to compile against same set of assemblies you main application was compiled agains. Addition of facade assemblies complicates situation even more because you compile against one assembly but use another at run time. In DNX case main application compilation was done when it was started so host had Roslyn workspace used for main app compilation and shared it with other components via `IComplicationServices` interface.

When request hits MVC Razor view for the first time `.cshtml` gets transpiled into `.cs` files and compiled referencing libraries listed in deps.json. Things become harder when application was compiled depending on package that contained reference assembly and runtime assembly: when applicaiton gets published only runtime assembly is copied to output by default. And if view would be compiled referencing runtime assembly it might get another set of API’s then main application did producing unexpected results.

To enable dynamic compilation support `preserveCompilationContext` needs to be set in `project.json`:

```
{
  ...
  "buildOptions": {
    "debugType": "portable",
    "emitEntryPoint": true,
    "preserveCompilationContext": true
  }
  ...
}
```

This makes `dotnet cli` put compilation assembly list and compilation options used to `deps.json` file and copy reference assemblies to `refs` folder in published output:

```
{
  "runtimeTarget": {
    "name": ".NETCoreApp,Version=v1.0",
    "signature": "09db60146a5b8a0d40c5ea0fb7485ab3bbdd4a1a"
  },
  "compilationOptions": {
    "defines": [
      "DEBUG",
      "TRACE",
      "NETCOREAPP1_0"
    ],
    "optimize": false,
    "emitEntryPoint": true,
    "debugType": "portable"
  },
  "targets": {
    ".NETCoreApp,Version=v1.0": {
      "TestApp/1.0.0": {
        "dependencies": {
          "Microsoft.NETCore.App": "1.0.0",
          "Newtonsoft.Json": "9.0.1"
        },
        "runtime": {
          "TestApp.dll": {}
        },
        "compile": {
          "TestApp.dll": {}
        }
      },
      "Newtonsoft.Json/9.0.1": {
        "dependencies": {
          "System.Runtime.Serialization.Primitives": "4.1.1"
        },
        "runtime": {
          "lib/netstandard1.0/Newtonsoft.Json.dll": {}
        },
        "compile": {
          "lib/netstandard1.0/Newtonsoft.Json.dll": {}
        }
      },
      "System.Runtime.Serialization.Primitives/4.1.1": {
        "dependencies": {
          "System.Resources.ResourceManager": "4.0.1",
          "System.Runtime": "4.1.0"
        },
        "runtime": {
          "lib/netstandard1.3/System.Runtime.Serialization.Primitives.dll": {}
        },
        "compile": {
          "ref/netstandard1.3/System.Runtime.Serialization.Primitives.dll": {}
        }
      },
      "System.Collections/4.0.11": {
        "dependencies": {
          "Microsoft.NETCore.Platforms": "1.0.1",
          "Microsoft.NETCore.Targets": "1.0.1",
          "System.Runtime": "4.1.0"
        },
        "compile": {
          "ref/netstandard1.3/System.Collections.dll": {}
        },
        "compileOnly": true
      }
      ...
    }
}
```

`refs` folder would contain all reference assemblies used for compilation (that differ from runtime assemblies):

```
Microsoft.CSharp.dll

Reference assemblies would be copied for desktop framework too so dynamic compilation would function without having targeting pack installed.
